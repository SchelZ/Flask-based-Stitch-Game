A FLASK based game I've made for my learning jurney 

- .webp sprites (could compress them more)
- backend - frontend compatibility using GET/POST requests (could use SOCKETIO library)
- HTML code autoscale for any smartphone display size
- javascript and jinja use to send data from the backend to frontend
